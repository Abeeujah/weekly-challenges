#### Weekly Rust Bytes Challenges

Welcome to Rust Bytes Challenges, a curated collection of coding challenges and Rust tips originally shared in the [Rust Bytes](https://weeklyrust.substack.com/) newsletter.

These challenges, tips, and exercises are designed to help rustaceans get comfortable reading and writing Rust.

If you're new to Rust, I would suggest starting with the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) or [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) first, and then returning to these challenges.

If you have basic Rust understanding, then it's time to flex your muscles by solving these challenges and putting your skills to the test.
